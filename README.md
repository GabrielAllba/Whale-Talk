## Project Prompt
There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:

- There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding the letter y.
- The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them.
- Once we have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is custom in the ocean.

Write a whale.cpp program that accomplishes this translation using loops and vectors.
## Technologies

- C++
